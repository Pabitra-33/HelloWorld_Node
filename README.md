#  HelloWorld_Node
Developed one server in Node.js that listens on a specific port and responds with "Hello, world!".
You can follow these steps to create one server in nodejs:

. Install Node.js:
If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website: Node.js.

. Create a new directory for your project:
Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory where you want to create your Node.js server.<br>
mkdir my-server
cd my-server

. Initialize a new Node.js project:
Run the following command to create a package.json file, which will hold information about your project and its dependencies.<br>
npm init -y

. Install Express.js:
Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web servers.<br>
npm install express

. Create your server file:
Inside your project directory, create a new file named server.js (or any other name you prefer).

. Run your server:
Save the server.js file, then run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to start the server:<br>
node server.js

. Access your server:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see "Hello, world!" displayed in the browser window.

That's it! We've created a simple Node.js server that listens on port 8000 and responds with "Hello, world!" when accessed.
