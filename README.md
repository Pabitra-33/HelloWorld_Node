#  HelloWorld_Node
To create a simple server in Node.js that listens on a specific port and responds with "Hello, world!", you can follow these steps:

. Install Node.js:
If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website: Node.js.

. Create a new directory for your project:
Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory where you want to create your Node.js server.
mkdir my-server
cd my-server

. Initialize a new Node.js project:
Run the following command to create a package.json file, which will hold information about your project and its dependencies.
npm init -y

. Install Express.js:
Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web servers.
npm install express

.Create your server file:
Inside your project directory, create a new file named server.js (or any other name you prefer).
